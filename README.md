# ENGLISH WORDS
This is @mkt-Do's repository to study English words.  
I add words everyday (hope).

## Rules
- create a file by day and create a directory by month
- must create pull request when I add words
- in pull request, I must write words except their meanings in description
- merge pull request after check meanings of words in description
